# Lesson Content — README.md Format

Every lesson's README.md follows this structure:

## Template

```markdown
# L<level>-M<module>.<lesson> — <Lesson Title>

**Level:** <Essentials | Practitioner>
**Duration:** <estimated time>

## Overview
<2-3 sentences: what the user will learn and why it matters>

## Prerequisites
- Completed: <list prior lessons>
- Infrastructure running: OGX (port 8321), vLLM, Qdrant
- <any additional requirements>

## Concepts
<Explain the key concepts before diving into code. Use clear, concise prose.
This section teaches the "why" — what problem does this solve?>

## Step-by-Step

### Step 1: <Action>
<Explain what we're doing and why>

```python
# Key code snippet (from main.py)
```

### Step 2: <Action>
...

## Running the Lesson

```bash
cd tutorial/level_<N>/<module>/<lesson>
uv sync
uv run python main.py
```

## Expected Output
<Show what the user should see in the terminal>

## Key Takeaways
- <3-5 bullet points summarizing what was learned>

## Next Steps
<Point to the next lesson and preview what it covers.
For end-of-level lessons, point to the next level.>
```

## Writing Guidelines by Level

### Level 1 — Essentials
- Keep it short. One OGX API per lesson.
- Show the simplest possible working example.
- Don't go into edge cases or advanced options.
- End with: "In Level 2, we'll explore this in more depth."

### Level 2 — Practitioner
- Build real-world scenarios, not toy examples.
- Explain tradeoffs and design decisions.
- Include comparison tables (e.g., provider configurations, deployment options).
- Cross-reference Level 1 concepts: "In L1-M3.1 you saw basic Vector IO. Now we'll configure Qdrant for production."

## General Guidelines

- Write for the target audience: developers building AI applications who know Python but may be new to OGX.
- Explain concepts before showing code — don't just dump code.
- Use progressive disclosure: introduce one concept at a time.
- Always explain WHY, not just WHAT.
- Keep it practical — every concept should have a working code example.
- Include "Expected Output" so users can verify they got the right result.
- Cross-reference related lessons across levels.
